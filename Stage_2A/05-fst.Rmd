# General optimization problem: FST filters {#sec:GuggemosEtAl}

## Description of the approach

@ch15HBSA defined a general approach to derive linear filters, based on an optimization problem of three criteria. 
Contrary to the local polynomial approach of @proietti2008, this method enables to control the size of the timeliness in order to minimize the phase-shift.

The following criteria are used:

- *Fidelity*, $F_g$: it's the variance reduction ratio. It is called "Fidelity" because we want the output signal to be as close as possible to the input signal where the noise component is removed
$$
F_g(\theta) = \sum_{k=-p}^{+f}\theta_{k}^{2}
$$
$F_g$ can be rewritten in a positive quadratic form: $F_g(\theta)=\theta'F\theta$ with $F$ the identity matrix of order $p+f+1$.

- *Smoothness*, $S_g$: it's the Henderson smoothness criterion (sum of the squared of the third difference of the coefficients of the filter). 
It measures the flexibility of the coefficient curve of a filter and the smoothness of the trend.
$$
S_g(\theta) = \sum_{j}(\nabla^{3}\theta_{j})^{2}
$$
$S_g$ could also be rewritten in a positive quadratic form: $S_g(\theta)=\theta'S\theta$ with $S$ a symmetric matrix of order $p+f+1$.


- *Timeliness*, $T_g$: it measures the phase shift between input and output signal for specific frequencies. 
When a linear filter is applied, the level input signal is also altered by the gain function. 
Therefore, it is natural to consider that the higher the gain is, the higher the phase shift impact is. 
That's why the timeliness criterion depends on the gain and phase shift functions ($\rho_\theta$ and $\varphi_{\theta}$), the link between both functions being made by a penalty function $f$.
$$
T_g(\theta)=\int_{\omega_{1}}^{\omega_{2}}f(\rho_{\theta}(\omega),\varphi_{\theta}(\omega))\ud\omega
$$
In this article we use $\omega_1=0$ and $\omega_2=2\pi/12$ (for monthly data): we focus on the phase shift impact on cycles of more than one year.
For the penalty function, we take $f\colon(\rho,\varphi)\mapsto\rho^2\sin(\varphi)^2$. 
Indeed, for this function, the timeliness criterion is analytically solvable ($T_g=\theta'T\theta$ with $T$ a square symmetric matrix of order $p+f+1$), which is better in a computational point of view.

The asymmetric filters are computed minimizing a weighted sum of the past three criteria, subject to some constraints. Those constraints are usually polynomial preservation.

$$
\begin{cases}
\underset{\theta}{\min} & J(\theta)=
\alpha F_g(\theta)+\beta S_g(\theta)+\gamma T_g(\theta)\\
s.t. & C\theta=a
\end{cases}
$$
The conditions $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\geq 0\text{ and }\alpha\beta\ne 0$ guarantee that $J(\theta)$ is a strictly convex function: therefore the optimization problem has a unique solution.

The Henderson symmetric filters can for example be computed with 
$$C=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \cdots&1\\
-h & \cdots&h \\
(-h)^2 & \cdots&h^2
\end{pmatrix},\quad
a=\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\0\\0
\end{pmatrix},\quad
\alpha=\gamma=0,\quad
\beta=1$$

This approach can be called as the "FST approach" in reference to the three indicators used in the optimization problem.
One drawback of this approach is that the different criteria are not normalized: their values cannot be compared with each other.
As a result, the value of weights has no sense.

**Advantages**:

- The asymmetric linear filter is independent of the symmetric filter, the data and the date of estimation.

- Unique solution to the optimization problem.

- The approach can be customized adding new criteria.

**Drawbacks**:

- The different criteria are not normalized: the associated weights cannot be compared.

## Extension with the revision criterion

The FST --- Fidelity-Smoothness-Timeliness --- approach is the only one that doesn't directly include a criterion on the revision error relative to a symmetric filter.  
This approach could be somewhat generalized in order to include the revision criterion, replacing in the orthogonal form $\theta$ by $(w-\theta)$ (with $w$ the symmetric filter), and $F$ by a matrix relative to the data (see @ch12HBSA).

In this paper, we consider the method that consists to extend the minimization problem of local polynomial filters adding the Timeliness criterion defined by @ch15HBSA^[This method is for example coded in Java by Jean Palate in https://github.com/palatej/jdemetra-core.].
Using the same notations as in section \@ref(subsec:lppasymf), $\theta=v$ and noting $g=v-w_p$, the Timeliness criterion can be rewritten:
$$
T_g(v)=v'Tv=g'Tg+2w_p'Tg+w_p'Tw_p
\quad(T\text{ being symmetric)}
$$
Moreover, the objective function $\varphi$ of equation \@ref(eq:lppasym) can be rewritten as:
\begin{align*}
\varphi(v)&=(v-w_{p})'D_{p}(v-w_{p})+
  w_{f}'D_{f}w_{f}+
  [\delta'(Z_{p}'v-Z'w)]^{2}+
2l'(U_{p}'v-U'w)\\
&=g'Qg-2Pg+2l'(U_{p}'v-U'w)+c\quad\text{with }
\begin{cases}
Q=D_p+Z_p\delta\delta'Z'_p \\
P=w_fZ_f\delta\delta'Z_p'\\
c\text{ a constant independent of }v
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

Adding the Timeliness criterion, it becomes:
$$
\widetilde\varphi(v)=g'\widetilde Qg-
2\widetilde Pg+2l'(U_{p}'v-U'w)+
\widetilde c\quad\text{with }
\begin{cases}
\widetilde Q=D_p+Z_p\delta\delta'Z'_p +\alpha_TT\\
\widetilde P=w_fZ_f\delta\delta'Z_p'-\alpha_Tw_pT\\
\widetilde c\text{ a constant independent of }v
\end{cases}
$$
where $\alpha_T$ is the weight associated to the Timeliness criterion. With $\alpha_T=0$ we find $\varphi(v)$.

The figures \@ref(fig:lppguglc) show the impact of $\alpha_T$ on the coefficients of the linear filter with the LC method:

- The more $\alpha_T$ increases, the more the coefficient associated to the current observation increases: this is what we expected.

- $\alpha_T$ impacts logarithmically the coefficients: we can restraint $\alpha_T$ to $[0,2000]$.

- As expected, including the timeliness criterion has more impact for the value of $q$ that gives filters with higher timeliness: it corresponds to $q\leq2$ for the LC method. 
For the QL method we find that $\alpha_T$ has an impact for medium values of $q$ ($2\leq q\leq4$).
